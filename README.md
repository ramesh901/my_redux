# my_redux
Building own redux

To run the project:
Just pull the index.html into your browser and click on 'New Note'

To work on various steps of building redux:
In the index.html change the src file name to any of compiled version present in the repository.

If the file ends with 'c' those are compiled version and the file without 'c' are original version.
For e.g my_redux.js is the original version. Using the command "babel my_redux.js --out-file my_reduxc.js" created the compiled version
For you convenience I uploaded both original and compiled version
